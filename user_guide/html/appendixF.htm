	<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class=auto-style8>1. Wait, what is a climate index?</p>
<p class=auto-style12>In the broadest 
sense an 
index is a representation of a particular aspect of some data. In the context of climate 
science an index is a calculation that reflects a certain aspect of the 
climate record. For example, there are indices that measure different aspects of 
the El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as well as indices that measure drought 
such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). A <em>climate extremes index</em> 
is one that characterises some extreme aspect of the climate record (as opposed 
to a mean aspect). For example, and of direct 
relevance to the indices calculated by ClimPACT2, if someone possesses 30 years 
of daily maximum temperatures then they have essentially a list of approximately 
10,950 daily values. One climate index that could be applied to this data is the 
calculation of the maximum of daily maximum temperatures for each year. This would 
show whether the peaks of maximum temperatures are changing over time and would 
return 30 values, one for each year. The application of this index reduces 
the 10,950 values to 30 values and provides insight into how the positive extremes of 
a particular climate record are changing. The purpose of any index is to extract 
some useful information from a larger dataset. </p>
<p class=auto-style14>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<em>Types of climate inidices in ClimPACT2</em></p>
<p class=auto-style14>ClimPACT2 reads in 
daily precipitation, maximum temperature and minimum temperature data and 
calculates numerous climate indices, most of which relate to extreme aspects of 
the climate. Substantial literature exists describing a 
large portion of these indices and also contain excellent introductions to climate 
indices in general (e.g. <a href="#Refs">Zhang et al. 2011</a>, <a href="#Refs">Zwiers et al. 2013</a>). 
Most of 
these indices (not all) fall under one of several categories, including min/max 
indices, threshold indices and duration indices.</p>
<p class=auto-style14><strong>Min/max 
indices</strong> indicate the minimum or maximum of some variable. For example, 
the maximum daily maximum temperature each year (see example above). Or 
conversely the 
minimum daily minimum temperature each year. These are both ClimPACT2 indices designated 
txx and tnn, respectively (see <a href="appendixA.htm">Appendix A</a>).</p>
<p class=auto-style12><strong>
Threshold indices</strong> count the number or proportion of days above or below a certain 
threshold. For example, the number of days each year where precipitation is 
greater than 10 mm (R10mm). The threshold in use may be <em>absolute</em> (like the 
previous example), or <em>percentile-based</em>. For example, the number of days 
where precipitation is higher than the 95th percentile of daily precipitation. 
Percentile-based indices provide a measure of how extremes are changing relative 
to the climatology of the site in question, as opposed to an arbitrary fixed 
value. This provides easier spatial interpretation of trends as each location is 
being measured according to the local climatology. For example, if counting the 
number of days where maximum temperature exceeds 30 degrees Celcius, this value 
will be much closer to 365 days per year in the tropics compared to the middle 
latitudes, and the temporal trend may be drastically different between the two 
climate zones. Instead, counting the number of days where maximum temperature 
exceeds the 90th percentile provides a substantially more robust measure of 
change. The percentiles used in calculating percentile-based indices are calculated 
over a user-specified base period (recommended by the World Meteorological 
Organisation to be 1961 - 1990).</p>
<p class=auto-style14><strong>Duration 
indices</strong> measure the length of time of or between certain events, or the 
aggregate number of days meeting a certain criteria. For example, the growing 
season length (GSL) measures the number of days between the first instance in 
the year when daily mean temperatures exceed that needed for growth and the 
first instance subsequently when daily mean temperature falls below that needed 
for growth.</p>
	<p class=auto-style10 style="line-height: 150%; ">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class=auto-style8>2. What
should be the length of the baseline/reference period?</p>
	<p class=auto-style12>The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) defines the 
	<a href="https://www.wmo.int/pages/themes/climate/statistical_depictions_of_climate.php">current state of 'normal' climate to be the average between 1961 and 1990</a>. 
	Thus, ideally these will be the years of your base period when calculating 
	the ClimPACT2 indices. However, it is recognised that many stations do not 
	have this length of record (or discontinuous records throughout this period), thus a period as 
	close to the above years as possible is desired, as well as a length of base 
	period as close to 30 yeras as possible. </p>
	<p class=auto-style12>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class=auto-style8>3. How
are missing data handled by ClimPACT2?</p>
	<p class=auto-style12>In the ClimPACT2 GUI, missing data need to be stored as -99.9 in the input data
files (see <a href="appendixB.htm">APPENDIX B</a>) but are converted to an internal format that R
recognises (NA, not available).</p>
	<p class=auto-style12>For netCDF files, missing data can be any valid real 
	value, so long as the missing_value attribute is defined accordingly.</p>
	<p class=auto-style12>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class=auto-style12><strong>4. Why do the SPI/SPEI output produce so much 
	missing data when my input files do not contain missing data?</strong></p>
	<p class=auto-style12>If you observe numerous missing data in your SPI or 
	SPEI output when calculated on gridded indices, despite your input not 
	having a corresponding amount of missing data, it is likely that you have 
	specified a base period that is too short. Try and specify a base period of 
	at least 30 years when possible. The
	<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SPEI/index.html">R package 
	used to calculate SPI and SPEI</a> has been known to produce numerous 
	missing data when a base period of ~10 years or less is specified.</p>
	<p class=auto-style12>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class=auto-style12><strong>5. Are the SPI/SPEI the best or only form of 
	drought indices?</strong></p>
	<p class=auto-style12>The SPI and SPEI are certainly not the only drought 
	indices available, and they are both relative newcomers compared to indices 
	such as the Palmer Drought Deverity Index (PDSI). Whether the SPI/SPEI are 
	the best is subjective and dependent upon many factors, however, they are 
	commonly used drought indices hence their inclusion in ClimPACT2. We 
	encourage you to read the original <a href="#Refs">SPI and SPEI 
	documentation</a>, as well as this excellent online resource by
	<a href="http://sac.csic.es/spei/">Vicente-Serrano and Begueria</a> on the 
	SPEI, its history and its application. An excellent example of the 
	responsible use of the SPI/SPEI can be seen in work by the
	<a href="ftp://ftp.dwd.de/pub/data/gpcc/html/gpcc_di_v_1-1_doi_download.html">
	Global Precipitation Climatology Centre</a>. </p>
	<p class=auto-style12>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class=auto-style8>6. How
can ClimPACT2 results be analysed further or used to produce customised
graphics using other popular packages?</p>
	<p class=auto-style12>The ClimPACT2 GUI produces its own plots of each index (in the
“plots” folder) once the software has completed running (see Section 3).
However, all of the indices output data are stored in the “indices” directory
in .csv format. Many graphics packages are able to handle this file format so
you can produce your own customised plots easily with your favourite
software package.</p>
	<p class=auto-style12>For output netCDF files, any netCDF viewer can be used 
	to view these. We recommend using 
	<a href="http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html">Ncview</a> 
	or <a href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/">Panoply</a> 
	for viewing netCDF output. Numerous programming language are available which allow you 
	to manipulate and plot netCDF files (e.g. R, Python, NCL, Ferret).</p>
	<p class=auto-style12>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class=auto-style8>7. Can
I add additional indices to ClimPACT2 myself?</p>
	<p class=auto-style7><span class="auto-style13"><a href="GUI.htm">Section 3.5</a> details how a custom 
	day count index can be created via the GUI. Besides this process, there is no easy method to 
	add indices but if you
are familiar with the R programming language you can amend the code to add
additional indices if you require. This is a good solution if you have very
specific sector requirements that are not covered by the current suite of
indices. </span> <span class="auto-style6">However, it is critical that the added 
	indices and any changes made to an existing index is documented.</span></p>
	<p class=auto-style12>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class=auto-style12><strong>8. Why does ClimPACT2 require so many R 
	packages to be installed?</strong></p>
	<p class=auto-style12>ClimPACT2 depends on code written by many other 
	individuals and institutions. These bodies have released their code as R 
	packages and to save &quot;re-inventing the wheel&quot; ClimPACT2 incorporates these R 
	packages into itself. This is typically considered best practice though does 
	lead to &quot;dependency hell&quot; where requiring a package may further require more 
	packages to be installed. Thus, currently there are approximately 15 R 
	packages that need to be installed to use ClimPACT2's full functionality. 
	However, this process only has to occur once.</p>
	<p class=auto-style12>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class=auto-style8>9. Can
I recommend additional indices to be added to the ET-SCI core set?</p>
	<p class=auto-style12>Yes, but any indices added to the core set have to be agreed
by the members of the 
	<a href="https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/ccl/opace/opace4/ET-SCI-4-1.php">ET-SCI</a>.</p>
